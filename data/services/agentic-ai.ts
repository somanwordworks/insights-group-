    problem: `
Many organizations run complex operations that depend on
manual decision-making. As systems and data grow, these
processes become slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale.
  `,

    whyItFails: `
Rule-based automation and traditional AI systems cannot adapt
to changing conditions or take end-to-end actions without
human intervention.
  `,

    solution: `
Agentic AI enables autonomous systems that can reason, plan,
and act across workflows by interacting with tools, data,
and enterprise systems.

    whatWeDo: `
Insights Group helps organizations identify suitable use cases,
design safe agent workflows, integrate with existing systems,
and apply governance to ensure reliable real-world deployment.
