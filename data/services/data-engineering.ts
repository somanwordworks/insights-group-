    problem: `
Organizations rely on data for analytics, reporting, and
decision-making. However, data is often spread across multiple
systems, arrives late, is inconsistent, or is not usable in
its raw form.
  `,

    whyItFails: `
Point-to-point integrations, manual data handling, and
fragile pipelines break as data volume and complexity grow.
Poor data quality leads to unreliable analytics and loss
of trust in data systems.
  `,

    solution: `
Data Engineering focuses on building reliable, scalable
data pipelines that collect, transform, and prepare data
for downstream analytics and operational use.
  `,

    whatWeDo: `
Insights Group designs and implements end-to-end data
engineering solutions, including data pipelines, data
transformations, and data cleansing workflows.
We focus on architectures that are maintainable, observable,
and aligned with real business use cases.
