    problem: `
Organizations generate and consume large volumes of text,
documents, code, and knowledge. Accessing the right information,
creating content, and responding quickly to users remains
manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming.
  `,

    whyItFails: `
Traditional search, rule-based systems, and static templates
cannot understand context, intent, or unstructured data.
They also struggle to scale across use cases and teams.
  `,

    solution: `
Generative AI enables systems that can understand context,
generate human-like responses, summarize information,
and assist users across knowledge-heavy workflows.
  `,

    whatWeDo: `
Insights Group helps organizations design and deploy
Generative AI solutions that are secure, governed, and
integrated with enterprise data, systems, and workflows.
We focus on practical use cases that deliver measurable value.
