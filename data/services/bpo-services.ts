    problem: `
Many organizations struggle with high operational overhead
in non-core functions such as customer support, back-office
operations, and IT support. These activities consume time,
resources, and management attention without directly driving
strategic differentiation.
  `,

    whyItFails: `
Internal teams are often stretched thin, processes are not
standardized, and scaling operations becomes expensive.
Outsourcing without clear structure and governance can also
lead to quality issues and loss of control.
  `,

    solution: `
BPO Services focus on transferring well-defined operational
functions to specialized teams while maintaining quality,
control, and alignment with business objectives. The goal is
to improve efficiency without compromising service standards.
