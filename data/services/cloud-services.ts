    problem: `
Organizations move to the cloud to improve scalability,
speed, and cost efficiency. However, many cloud initiatives
struggle due to poor architectural decisions, unplanned
migrations, and lack of governance.
As a result, cloud environments become expensive, complex,
and difficult to manage.
  `,

    whyItFails: `
Lift-and-shift migrations replicate on-premise problems
in the cloud. Platform choices are often driven by vendor
preferences rather than workload requirements.
Without proper design, cloud costs grow rapidly and systems
fail to deliver expected agility.
  `,

    solution: `
Cloud Services focus on designing cloud architectures that
align with business needs, performance goals, and cost
constraints. This includes planned migrations, integration
with existing systems, and adoption of cloud-native patterns
where appropriate.
  `,

    whatWeDo: `
Insights Group helps organizations plan and execute cloud
journeys with clarity and control. We provide cloud advisory,
migration strategy, and integration services focused on
long-term sustainability rather than short-term moves.
We work across major cloud platforms with a vendor-neutral
approach.
