    problem: `
Many digital products fail not because of technology, but
because users struggle to understand, navigate, or trust them.
Poorly designed experiences lead to low adoption, high support
costs, and frustration for both customers and internal users.
  `,

    whyItFails: `
User experience is often treated as a visual layer added late
in the development process. Decisions are made based on
assumptions rather than real user behavior, resulting in
interfaces that look good but do not work well in practice.
  `,

    solution: `
User Experience focuses on designing products and systems
around real user needs and behaviors. It combines research,
design thinking, and iterative validation to ensure usability,
clarity, and effectiveness across digital experiences.

    whatWeDo: `
Insights Group works with organizations to design user
experiences that support real business workflows.
We conduct user research, apply design thinking, and define
interaction patterns that align product goals with how users
actually work, reducing friction and improving adoption.
