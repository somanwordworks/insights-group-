    problem: `
Organizations make critical technology decisions around
data platforms, AI adoption, cloud strategy, and application
modernization. These decisions are often made under pressure,
with incomplete information and competing stakeholder opinions.
Poor decisions lead to long-term cost, complexity, and rework.
  `,

    whyItFails: `
Technology choices are frequently driven by trends, vendor
recommendations, or short-term goals. Without a structured
decision framework, organizations struggle to align technology
with business outcomes and future growth.
  `,

    solution: `
Strategy & Consulting focuses on bringing clarity to complex
technology decisions. It applies structured thinking, trade-off
analysis, and real-world experience to define practical and
sustainable technology strategies.
